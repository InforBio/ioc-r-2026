    "text": "What is IOC?\nThe InforBio platform has developed an “Interactive Online Companionship” (IOC) specifically tailored to initiate researchers into bioinformatics. The IOC involved one-to-many virtual work sessions where companions are trained to analyze their own data.\nAll IOC programs are structured into a series of modules, with each module building upon the knowledge and skills acquired in the previous one. One module lasts one week, during which companions dive into online materials to ensure they understand and internalize the content. Companions then complete quizzes and exercises using both public and their own data to gauge their understanding, receiving personalized feedback on their work. To facilitate their learning, we provide access to computational resources such as Rstudio and Galaxy servers. The module wraps up with a 2.5 hours’ videoconference to recap the week’s material and address any questions. These videoconferences are recorded and made available for later viewing, ensuring continuous access to the learning resources.\nBy the end of an IOC, companions will be equipped with expertise and confidence to run their own analyses independently."

(Slack Windows desktop, Slack Mac desktop)\nAnd you will receive an invitation link to join the IOC Slack of your group.\n\nPost messages in the correct channel, e.g., “questions” for asking about course content.\nWhen asking questions, please be specific and clear with a minimal context, include screenshots or error message to help others understand the issue.\nWhen discussing a question, please reply in the thread to avoid flooding the channel.\n\n\n\nTrello\nTrello is a tool to help you stay organized and track your learning progress.\nYou will be invited to join a Trello board for this IOC. We will create one list per student, please add one card for each session to add your notes, summary, etc."

The results were measured to see which genes are active at different stages in Yeast cell cycling. Several strains were tested, including wildtype and some with specific genes knock-downs. Samples were taken at nine time points over two cell cycles (two hours).\n\n\nThe R script\nThe r_w01_exos.R script contains all commands R for the exercise."

    "text": "Play with RStudio\nIn your R project, open the downloaded R script r_w01_exos.R: In RStudio menu bar, click File -&gt; Open File -&gt; selec the Rscript, or click the file in the Files pane.\n\nImport Data\n\nIf you are not familiar with the file content, click on the CSV file in Files pane to “View” it. Identify the column separator and the decimal sign.\nImport the file into R and call the imported data “counts”.\nCopy paste the command shown in the R console.\n\n\n\nExercises\n\nWhat is the absolute file path of the imported data counts? What is its relative path? Verify your answer using the function file.exists().\n\n\ngetwd() # show the current working directory\n\nabs_path &lt;- \"\" # put your answer between quotes\nrel_path &lt;- \"\" # put your answer between quotes\n\nfile.exists(abs_path) # check if R finds your file using absolute path\nfile.exists(rel_path) # check if R finds your file using relative path\n\n\nWhat is the dimension (number of rows and columns) of the data frame? Check the “Environment” panel or use the function dim().\n\n\ndim(counts)\n\n[1] 45 41\n\n\nIn the “Environment” panel, click on the tabular icon next to the dataset to visualize the it.\nWe can extract all gene expressions for the sample named “WT.2” using counts[[\"WT.2\"]].\n\nTry mode() on the expression data for “WT.2”, what does it return?\n\n\nmode(counts[[\"WT.2\"]])\n\n[1] \"numeric\"\n\n\n\nCalculate the average expression (mean()) and standard deviation (sd()) of genes from the sample “WT.2”.\n\n\nmean(counts[[\"WT.2\"]])\n\n[1] 148\n\nsd(counts[[\"WT.2\"]])\n\n[1] 392.7854\n\n\n\nGenerate descriptive statistics for all genes from the sample “WT.2” using summary().\n\n\nsummary(counts[[\"WT.2\"]])\n\n   Min. 1st Qu.

What does the distribution look like?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStats Time!\n\n\n\nHistograms help us see how data is spread out. They show how many data points fall into different intervals, or bins. By looking at a histogram, we can quickly understand the shape of the data, like if it’s skewed or has outliers. It’s a simple way to get an overview of your data.\n\n\n\nhist(counts[[\"WT.2\"]])\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStats Time!\n\n\n\nlog2 Transformation\nA log2 transformation is commonly used to normalize data and reduce skewness, especially in datasets with values spanning several orders of magnitude. Many biological data, like gene expression counts, tend to have a highly skewed distribution with a long tail of large values. The log2 transformation helps:\n\nStabilize variance – Makes data with large differences more comparable.\nHandle ratios – Converts multiplicative relationships into additive ones, simplifying interpretation.\nImprove normality – Makes the data distribution closer to normal, which is often required for statistical tests.\n\n\n\n\nplot(\n  x = counts[[\"WT.2\"]], y = log2(counts[[\"WT.2\"]]),\n  xlab = \"Original Scale\", ylab = \"log2 Scale\",\n  main = \"Gene expression for the sample WT.2\"\n)\nabline(v = 256, col = \"red\", lty = 2) # Add vertical line \nabline(h = 8, col = \"red\", lty = 2) # Add horizontal line\ntext(x = 500, y = 7, labels = expression(2^8 == 256)) # Add equation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRe draw the histogram with the log2 transformed data, what does the distribution look like now?\n\nhist(log2(counts[[\"WT.2\"]]))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can extract the gene name column (called “Feature”) and the column for sample “WT.2” using this command: counts[, c(\"Feature\", \"WT.2\")]. Export the data to a file called WT_2_expression.csv, store this file in the outputs folder.\n\n\nwrite_csv(counts[, c(\"Feature\", \"WT.2\")], file = \"outputs/WT_2_expression.csv\")\n\nCheck in the outputs folder, do you see the saved file? Does the content correspond to your expectations?\n\n\nGood job! 👏👏 You’ve taken your first big steps into R, and you’re off to a great start, keep it up!"
