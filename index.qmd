# Welcome To the IOC Training!

## What is IOC?

The **InforBio** platform has developed an "**Interactive Online Companionship**" (IOC)
specifically tailored to initiate researchers into bioinformatics.
The IOC involved one-to-many virtual work sessions where companions are trained to **analyze their own data**.

All IOC programs are structured into a series of modules,
with each module building upon the knowledge and skills acquired in the
previous one.
One module lasts one week, during which companions dive into **online materials**
to ensure they understand and internalize the content.
Companions then complete **quizzes and exercises** using both public and
their own data to gauge their understanding,
receiving **personalized feedback** on their work.
To facilitate their learning, we provide access to computational resources such as Rstudio and Galaxy servers.
The module wraps up with a 2.5 hours' videoconference to recap
the week's material and address any questions.
These videoconferences are recorded and made available for later viewing,
ensuring continuous access to the learning resources.

By the end of an IOC, companions will be equipped with expertise and
confidence to run their own analyses independently.

## IOC tools

### Zoom

We will use Zoom for videoconferencing.

Please follow the rules for usage:

- Please be on time.
- Technical setup:  
  - Ensure your internet connection is stable.
  - Test your camera and microphone before the session.
- During the session:  
  - Keep your microphone muted unless you're speaking to avoid background noise.
  - Use the “Raise Hand” feature if you want to ask a question during the lecture.
  - Keep your camera on if possible to create a more interactive environment.
- Recorded sessions are for personal review only. Do not distribute them without permission.


### Slack

Slack is a dedicated workspace for communication and staying connected between sessions.

If you haven't already use it, you need to create a [Slack account](https://slack.com/get-started#/createnew).

If you have a Slack account, you can either connect to the account using this [webpage](https://slack.com/signin#/signin), or use a desktop version on your computer. ([Slack Windows desktop](https://slack.com/intl/fr-fr/downloads/windows), [Slack Mac desktop](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/slack-for-desktop/id803453959?mt=12))

And you will receive an invitation link to join the IOC Slack of your group.

- Post messages in the correct channel, e.g., "questions" for asking about course content.
- When asking questions, please be specific and clear with a minimal context, include screenshots or error message to help others understand the issue.
- When discussing a question, please reply in the thread to avoid flooding the channel.


### Trello

Trello is a tool to help you stay organized and track your learning progress.

You will be invited to join a Trello board for this IOC.
We will create one list per student, 
please add one card for each session to add your notes, summary, etc.
