Write your code directly in a Quarto document.

To create a Quarto document: go to **File** -> **New File** -> **Quarto Document**, then click **Create**.

# Import data.

We need to use two data for this exercise:

- the bulk RNAseq gene expression data from the [`read-counts.csv`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/InforBio/IOC/refs/heads/main/ioc_r/exos_data/read-counts.csv) file.
- the diffenrential expression (DE) analysis results [`toy_DEanalysis`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/InforBio/IOC/refs/heads/main/ioc_r/exos_data/toy_DEanalysis.csv).

Reminder: the DE results were obtained by comparing SET1 samples to WT samples using data from `read-counts.csv`

1. Import DE analysis result (`toy_DEanalysis.csv`) and name it as `de_res`.

(You can either use the basic function `read.csv()` or the function `read_csv()` from the {`readr`} package.)

2. Import the `read-counts.csv` file and name it `counts`.

You can either use the first column (Feature) to name the rows of your data frame or keep the fisrt column as is.
It will just change how you filter data later.
Here I import the data without using the 1st column to name the rows of my data frame.

# Find Genes of Interest

3. Find the genes which satisfy the following conditions:

- log2 fold change < -1 or > 1 (a.k.a, the absolute log2 fold change is bigger than 1)
- adjusted p-value < 0.05

Store the results in a variable `target_genes`.

# Draw Boxplots

4. Load the {`ggplot2`} package.

5. Draw a boxplot for the 1st gene of the `target_genes` to show the expression level between SET1 and WT samples.

Hints: you need to extract the expression data for the gene from the `counts` and build a data frame for the boxplot.


6. Write a function that generates a boxplot for a specified gene,
allowing the user to input the gene name.
Use your function to create boxplots for all the remaining genes in the `target_genes`.
