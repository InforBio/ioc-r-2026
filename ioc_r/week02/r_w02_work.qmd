Write your code directly in a Quarto document.

To create a Quarto document: go to **File** -> **New File** -> **Quarto Document**, then click **Create**.


Use the following code to import the file "read-counts.csv" 
(you have already downloaded it for the hand-on examples of week01).
Name the imported data `expr_data`.

```{r}
expr_data <- read.table(
  file = "../exos_data/read-counts.csv",  # replace the path with your own
  header = TRUE, sep = ",", row.names = 1
)
```

1. Is the imported data a matrix?

```{r}

```

2. Transform it to a matrix using `as.matrix()`.

```{r}

```

3. What are the dimensions of the matrix?

```{r}

```

4. What are the column names and row names?

```{r}

```


5. Extract all genes' expression for the 10 WT samples (WT.1, WT.2, ..., WT.10),
and store it in a variable called `expr_wt`.
Show the first few rows using `head()` function.

```{r}

```

6. What is the average expression level across all WT samples for each gene?
Store the results in a variable called `avg_wt`.

```{r}

```

7. Draw a histogram to check the distribution of the average gene expression level for WT samples.

```{r}

```

8. Repeat questions 5 to 7 for the SET1 samples (SET1.1, SET1.2, ..., SET1.10).

```{r}

```

9. What is the absolute difference between the average expression of WT and SET1 samples for each gene? 
Which gene shows the biggest difference?

Hints:

- Use `abs()` to get the absolute value. (`?abs`)
- The `max()` function helps to find the maximum value from a vector. (`?max`)
- The `which.max()` function helps to find the index of the maximum value from a vector. (`?which.max`)

```{r}

```


10. Compare the following matrix to the one we created during the course' exercise (the matrix named `expression_levels`).
What is the key difference in how the matrix is constructed? 
Provide a brief explanation.

```{r}
matrix(
  c(10, 12, 15, 20, 18, 22, 14, 16, 19, 8, 9, 7, 25, 30, 28),
  ncol = 3
)
```

11. Click "Render" to generate your Quarto report.
