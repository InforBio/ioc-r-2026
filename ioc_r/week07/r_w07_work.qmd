## Mini Data Project (Part 2)

We already saw how to import and tidy the data for structure 1 during the exercise.

Just a reminder, the expression of 20 genes was measured in mice aged from 10 to 60 days, with both male and female mice, and each group consists of 6 animals. The gene expression data is stored in two files, one for each brain structure. Within each file, rows represent the different ages, and columns represent the gene, sex, and animal.

The data is available in two CSV files:

- [data_anonym_struc1_noise.csv](../exos_data/data_anonym_struc1_noise.csv)
- [data_anonym_struc2_noise.csv](../exos_data/data_anonym_struc2_noise.csv)

1. Import the two data files and reshape them the same way you did up to question 9 of the exercise.
Then, combine the two datasets into one.
Make sure to adjust any parameters as needed.

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true" title="Hints"}
You can combine datasets by stacking their rows together to create one final data frame.
(Use `dplyr::bind_rows()` or `rbind()` for this.)

2. Remove lines with NA in expression value.


3. For the mice of 20 days, count how many measurements you have for each brain structure in genes 4 and 5 separately.


4. Explore how brain structure and genes 16 to 20 relate to each other using the `GGally::ggpairs()` function.

Which pair of variables correlated the most?


5. Based on the previous figure, which gene appears to show the largest difference in expression between the two brain structures?

Choose an appropriate figure to display this gene's expression across the brain structures.
