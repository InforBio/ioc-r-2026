## Goals

- Get familiar with the RStudio
- Create an R project in RStudio
- Import data file into RStudio
- Export data from RStudio

## Create an R project

1. Open RStudio, create a new R project in the folder of your choice.

Some rules for naming your project:  

  - Choose a short and descriptive name.
  - Use snake case (lowercase letters and underscores only).
  Avoid special characters (such as `!`, `#`, ) and spaces.
  - The name cannot starts with numbers.

2. Open your R project, create three new folders, *i.e.*, `data`, `scripts`, `outputs`.

3. Download two files:

  -  An R script named "r_w01_exos.R" for this week's exercise ([here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/InforBio/ioc-r-2026/refs/heads/main/ioc_r/week01/r_w01_exos.R){target='_blank'}), save it into the `scripts` folder.
  - A data file called "read-counts.csv" ([here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/InforBio/ioc-r-2026/refs/heads/main/ioc_r/exos_data/read-counts.csv){target='_blank'}), put it into the `data` folder.

If you are using RStudio server, files can be uploaded using the "Upload" icon
in the *Files* pane.

## Files Description

### Data File

We'll be working with a gene expression dataset as an example,
sourced from this [link](https://monashbioinformaticsplatform.github.io/r-more/){target='_blank'}.

The data comes from an experiment using PCR to study 44 genes.
The results were measured to see which genes are active at different stages in Yeast cell cycling.
Several strains were tested, including wildtype and some with specific genes knock-downs.
Samples were taken at nine time points over two cell cycles (two hours).

### The R script

The `r_w01_exos.R` script contains all commands R for the exercise.

## Play with RStudio

In your R project, open the downloaded R script `r_w01_exos.R`:
In RStudio menu bar, click *File* -> *Open File* -> selec the Rscript,
or click the file in the *Files* pane.

### Import Data

1. If you are not familiar with the file content, click on the CSV file in *Files* pane to "View" it. Identify the column separator and the decimal sign.
2. Import the file into R and call the imported data "counts".
3. Copy paste the command shown in the R console.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| message: false

library(readr)
counts <- read_csv("../exos_data/read-counts.csv")
```

### Exercises

1. What is the absolute file path of the imported data `counts`?
What is its relative path?
Verify your answer using the function `file.exists()`.

```{r}
#| eval: false

getwd() # show the current working directory

abs_path <- "" # put your answer between quotes
rel_path <- "" # put your answer between quotes

file.exists(abs_path) # check if R finds your file using absolute path
file.exists(rel_path) # check if R finds your file using relative path
```

2. What is the dimension (number of rows and columns) of the data frame?
Check the "Environment" panel or use the function `dim()`.

```{r}
dim(counts)
```

In the "Environment" panel, click on the tabular icon next to the dataset to visualize the it.

We can extract all gene expressions for the sample named "WT.2" using `counts[["WT.2"]]`.

3. Try `mode()` on the expression data for "WT.2", what does it return?

```{r}
mode(counts[["WT.2"]])
```

4. Calculate the average expression (`mean()`) and standard deviation (`sd()`) of genes from the sample "WT.2".

```{r}
mean(counts[["WT.2"]])
sd(counts[["WT.2"]])
```

5. Generate descriptive statistics for all genes from the sample "WT.2" using `summary()`.

```{r}
summary(counts[["WT.2"]])
```

What are quartiles?

Quartiles are three values that split sorted data into four equal parts.

IQR (Interquartile range) = Q3 - Q1
:::


6. Generate a histogram for the "WT.2" sample using `hist()`. What does the distribution look like?

::: {.callout-note title="Stats Time!"}
**Histograms** help us see how data is spread out.
They show how many data points fall into different intervals, or *bins*.
By looking at a histogram, we can quickly understand the shape of the data,
like if it’s skewed or has outliers.
It's a simple way to get an overview of your data.
:::

```{r}
hist(counts[["WT.2"]])
```

**log2 Transformation**

A log2 transformation is commonly used to normalize data and reduce skewness,
especially in datasets with values spanning several orders of magnitude. 
Many biological data, like gene expression counts,
tend to have a highly skewed distribution with a long tail of large values.
The log2 transformation helps:

-  Stabilize variance – Makes data with large differences more comparable.
- Handle ratios – Converts multiplicative relationships into additive ones, simplifying interpretation.
- Improve normality – Makes the data distribution closer to normal, which is often required for statistical tests.
:::

```{r}
plot(
  x = counts[["WT.2"]], y = log2(counts[["WT.2"]]),
  xlab = "Original Scale", ylab = "log2 Scale",
  main = "Gene expression for the sample WT.2"
)
abline(v = 256, col = "red", lty = 2) # Add vertical line 
abline(h = 8, col = "red", lty = 2) # Add horizontal line
text(x = 500, y = 7, labels = expression(2^8 == 256)) # Add equation
```

Re draw the histogram with the log2 transformed data,
what does the distribution look like now?

```{r}
hist(log2(counts[["WT.2"]]))
```


7. We can extract the gene name column (called "Feature") and the column for sample "WT.2" using this command: `counts[, c("Feature", "WT.2")]`.
Export the data to a file called `WT_2_expression.csv`, store this file in the `outputs` folder.

```{r}
#| eval: false 

write_csv(counts[, c("Feature", "WT.2")], file = "outputs/WT_2_expression.csv")
```

Check in the `outputs` folder, do you see the saved file?
Does the content correspond to your expectations?

#### Good job! 👏👏 You've taken your first big steps into R, and you're off to a great start, keep it up!
