Note: There may be other valid ways to solve this exercise â€” this is just one possible solution!

1. Import the data file "**visceral_fat.csv**".

  - First, download the `visceral_fat.csv` file via this [link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/InforBio/IOC/refs/heads/main/ioc_r/exos_data/visceral_fat.csv).
  - Then, upload the file to a folder of your choice within your RStudio project.
  - Next, import the data into RStudio and name the data frame `visceral_fat`. 

Tip:

Use the **click-button method** in RStudio to upload and import the file. Then, copy and paste the R commands generated into a code chunk in your Quarto report.

Once imported, you can use the `visceral_fat` dataset for further analysis in your report.

```{r}
# command from the import pop-up window
visceral_fat <- read.csv("../exos_data/visceral_fat.csv") # replace the path by your own
```

2. Summarize the dataset.

Run the function `summary(visceral_fat)` to generate a summary of the dataset. Describe what information you obtained.

```{r}
summary(visceral_fat)
```

This function returns the minimum, maximum, mean, and quartile values for each column.
The column `ethnicity` contains one missing value (`NA`).

3. Draw a histogram.

Create a histogram for the diastolic blood pressure using the column `visceral_fat[["diastolic_bp__mmhg"]]`. Describe what you observe from the plot.

```{r}
hist(visceral_fat[["diastolic_bp__mmhg"]])
```

The histogram shows a skewed distribution with some extreme values. Most of the values are concentrated in the bins on the left, while a single bin far on the right suggests outliers.

4. Handle an outlier.

After consulting with a clinician, you discover that the 27th value of the diastolic blood pressure was incorrectly recorded.

  - Ignore this value using `visceral_fat[["diastolic_bp__mmhg"]][-27]`
  - Redraw the histogram after excluding the outlier and describe any changes you observe.

```{r}
hist(visceral_fat[["diastolic_bp__mmhg"]][-27])
```

The histogram becomes more symmetrical after removing the outlier.
The most frequent values fall within the range of 65 to 70.

5. Compare mean and median.

Calculate the mean (`mean()`) and the median (`median()`) for the diastolic blood pressure

  - before ignoring the 27th value: `visceral_fat[["diastolic_bp__mmhg"]]` 
  - after ignoring the 27th value: `visceral_fat[["diastolic_bp__mmhg"]][-27]`
  
Describe how the outlier affects the mean and median.

```{r}
mean(visceral_fat[["diastolic_bp__mmhg"]])
median(visceral_fat[["diastolic_bp__mmhg"]])
mean(visceral_fat[["diastolic_bp__mmhg"]][-27])
median(visceral_fat[["diastolic_bp__mmhg"]][-27])
```

The median remains unchanged.

The mean decreases after removing the outlier,
highlighting its sensitivity to extreme values.
The median, in contrast, is robust to extreme values.
