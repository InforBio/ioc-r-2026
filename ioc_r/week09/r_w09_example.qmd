## Goals

- Understand the basics of Quarto.
- Create your first Quarto report by walking through a mini data project.

## Mini Data Project

### Data Import & Exploration

1. Import the two data datasets with `read_csv()` using following links:

- Yeast gene annotation data:
`"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/InforBio/ioc-r-2026/refs/heads/main/ioc_r/exos_data/mart_export.txt.gz"`,
  name the data as `annot`.
- Gene differential expression analysis (SET1 *vs.* WT):
`"https://inforbio.github.io/ioc-r-2026/ioc_r/exos_data/toy_DEanalysis.csv"`, name the data as `de_res`.

What are the dimensions of each dataset?

```{r}


```

2. Which chromosome has the highest number of genes?
Which chromosome has the lowest number of genes?

```{r}

```

3. For protein-coding genes, calculate the maximum, minimum, average, and median percentage of GC content for each chromosome.

```{r}

```

4. Comparing `de_res` and `annot` genes. Do all genes in `de_res` exist in `annot`? How many genes in `de_res` lack annotation information?

```{r}

```


5. Add the annotation information to `de_res`, merge the `annot` data with `de_res` using either:
- the `merge()` function (base R), or
- the `left_join()` function (from the dplyr package, `?left_join`)

```{r}


```

### Data Visualization & Statistical Analysis

6. Generate a Volcano plot for differential expression results with the following specifications:

- X-axis: Log2 fold change
- Y-axis: -log10(p-value)
- Color: Highlight genes with adjusted p-values below 0.5 in red color (consider creating a new column to flag these).
- Display gene names for points with absolute log2 fold change greater than 1.5 (use `geom_text_repel()`).
- Reference lines:
  - Horizontal red dash line at the Bonferroni-adjusted p-value threshold (0.05 / Ntest)
  - Vertical dash lines at log2 fold change values of 1.5 and -1.5
- Theme: Apply `theme_light()` for the plot appearance.

```{r}

```

So far, we've analyzed gene expression between two groups (SET1 *vs.* WT).
How can we compare expression levels across four groups (WT, SET1, SET1.RRP6, RRP6)?
For example, how can we test if the average expression level of a gene is the same across these four groups?

:::{.callout-tip title="Stats Time!"}
**One-way ANOVA**

ANOVA (**AN**alysis **O**f **VA**riance) helps us determine whether the means of multiple groups are different. Instead of comparing means directly (as in t-tests),
ANOVA compares the variances within (intra) and between groups (inter) to infer differences in means.

We assume that the variance within each group is the same across all groups.

- $H_0: \mu_1 = \mu_2 = ... = \mu_n$
- $H_1$: there is at least one group which has an average different than other groups.

Which is equals to test:

- $H_0: \sigma^2_{\text{inter group}} = \sigma^2_{\text{intra group}}$
- $H_1: \sigma^2_{\text{inter group}} > \sigma^2_{\text{intra group}}$

If the means are truly different, the variation between groups ($\sigma^2_{\text{inter group}}$) should be greater than the variation within groups ($\sigma^2_{\text{intra group}}$).

ANOVA calculates the F statistic, which is a ratio:

$F = \frac{\sigma^2_{\text{inter group}}}{\sigma^2_{\text{intra group}}}$

, and the probability of obtaining an F-statistic as extreme as the observed one (the p-value), assuming the null hypothesis is true.

Conditions of applying ANOVA:

- Independence: Observations in each group must be independent.
- Normality: Data should be approximately normally distributed (can be checked using the Shapiro test).
- Homoscedasticity (homogeneity of variance): Variances across groups should be roughly equal (Leveneâ€™s test or Bartlettâ€™s test can check this).

In R, the function `aov()` is used to perform ANOVA.
::: 

Let's take the gene *LOH1* as example.

7. Import the expression data using this link:
`"https://inforbio.github.io/ioc-r-2026/ioc_r/exos_data/read-counts.csv"`

```{r}

```


8. Given the imported counts data, how can we reshape it to extract the necessary information and obtain a tibble with the following columns?

- "value": Expression values of the gene *LOH1*
- "group": Sample groups (Explore how to use the `str_replace()` function to extract group based on sample name)

```{r}
?str_replace


```

9. Assume that all conditions of ANOVA are verified.
Perform an ANOVA (`aov()`) test and use `summary()` to obtain the results.
If we take $\alpha=0.05$, what is your conclusion?

```{r}


```

10. Conduct a Tukey Honest Significant Differences (TukeyHSD) test to check which groups differ significantly. (`?TukeyHSD`)

```{r}

```

11. Visualize the expression levels of the *LOH1* gene across the four groups using a boxplot.

```{r}


```

### Bonus

Verify the assumptions for conducting an ANOVA test:

```{r}


```

The RRP6 data does not follow a normal distribution.

```{r}


```

Moreover, the assumption of homoscedasticity (equal variance) is not met.

Therefore, an ANOVA is not appropriate, and a non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test should be used instead.

```{r}

```

#### Great work, youâ€™ve made it to the end! ðŸŽ‰ and now you're ready to take on even more! Keep exploring new things, there's so much more R can do for you!
